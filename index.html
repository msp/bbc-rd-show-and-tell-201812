# Decompression

> Decompression unravels in the spirit of a ‘happening’ – an encounter between audiences, space and the elements of cinematic abstraction, explored via the artists' longstanding interest in expanded cinema and sound system culture.

.footnote[https://sallygolding.com/performance#/decompression]

---

> Threaded throughout the performance is an examination of the original text *Expanded Cinema by Gene Youngblood* (1970), which re-purposed, poses questions concerning contemporary technological-utopia, pressing the issue of the viewing experience and mass entertainment into relevance with regards to today’s globally connected audiences. The performance also features a 'prepared' light sensitive screen, tactile projection beams, and surround sound.

# Transduction

> ‘Transduction’ is a performative opti-sonic intervention designed for projection and multi-channel sound. Presented as an abstract animation of visual music, illusory visual and psychoacoustic effects probe perception via experimental psychological processes and kinetic optical techniques.

> Building on the lineage of Primtives sympathetic approach to the material aspects of live audiovisual art, further deformation and alteration of coded light brings a new realisation to the relationships between seeing sound and hearing colour.

# Tidal Cycles

TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a language for live coding patterns.
It allows you to make musical patterns with text, describing sequences and
ways of transforming and combining them, exploring complex interactions
between simple parts.

---

# Pattern Generation

Tidal is a Domain Specific Language written in Haskell.
It's a declarative language for describing patterns, transformations and effects.


---

# Emergent behaviour

> In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.

> The butterfly effect is the concept that small causes can have large effects. Initially, it was used with weather prediction but later the term became a metaphor used in and out of science.

---

# Text Interface

```haskell
d1 $ sound "bd hh bd sd"
```
Tidal does not make sound itself, but is designed for use with the SuperDirt synth, and can control other synths over Open Sound Control or MIDI.

???

SuperDirt is writen in Supercollider.

The OSC control here is crucial!

---

# Pattern Composition

```haskell
d1
$ sound "bd hh bd sd"
# gain 0.9
# lpf $ slow 2 $ cosine
```

Tidal is highly composable in that pattern transformations can be easily combined together, allowing you to quickly create complex patterns from simple ingredients.

# SuperCollider

> SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound. It is free and open source software available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.


---

# Components

.big-list[
- **scsynth**, a real-time audio server, forms the core of the platform. It features 400+ unit generators (“UGens”) for analysis, synthesis, and processing.

- **sclang**, an interpreted programming language. It is focused on sound, but not limited to any specific domain. sclang controls scsynth via Open Sound Control.

- **scide** is an editor for sclang with an integrated help system.

# Hello World

```SuperCollider
// modulate a sine frequency and a noise amplitude with another sine
// whose frequency depends on the horizontal mouse pointer position
{
        var x = SinOsc.ar(MouseX.kr(1, 100));
        SinOsc.ar(300 * x + 800, 0, 0.1)
        +
        PinkNoise.ar(0.1 * x + 0.1)
}.play;
```

# Processing

> Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

# Hello World

```Java
// Draw 5 slanted lines on the screen

line(10, 80, 30, 40);  // Left line
line(20, 80, 40, 40);
line(30, 80, 50, 40);  // Middle line
line(40, 80, 60, 40);
line(50, 80, 70, 40);  // Right line
```
